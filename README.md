### Project
Classification of MRI brain images for tumor detection.  

- **Classes**: Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary Tumor, No Tumor  
- **Models**: Residual Neural Network (ResNet) vs. Vision Transformer (ViT)  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy and Training Speed


### Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - [Brain tumor multimodal image (CT & MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtozalikhon/brain-tumor-multimodal-image-ct-and-mri)


### Learning Goals
- Learn about applying the Visual Transformer on images;  
- Make comparisons with the previous state-of-the-art method, ResCNN, for computer vision;  
- Apply data augmentation techniques to increase sample size and improve model performance.
